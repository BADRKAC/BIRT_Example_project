# BIRT_Example_project
BIRT is an open source technology platform used to create data visualizations and reports that can be embedded into rich client and web applications.
 
 1 - birt-runtime-3_7_2 is the birt generator where you can create your report model
 2 - Create a simple project that call the birt generator (I put some example classes from my old java batch project to inspire you )
 3 - Note taht there is better tools/technology right now like Jasper report, This Birt examlpe project is for birt community and also for developers who encounter problems with birt setup in their project
 4- For birt project use eclipse Eclipse indigo and create xxx.rptdesign file or use mine (GrcNotifHebdo.rptdesign) for inspiration.
